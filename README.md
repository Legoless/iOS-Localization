iOS-Localization
================

This project is a community project to translate iOS operating system into the languages that are missing from the list by Apple. Only jailbroken devices are currently able to install this localization. Project is translated by a large team and it is happening on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/apple-ios/).

The documentation will help you with translating and creating packages from finished translations. This project also contains scripts that will help you with automating those procedures.

The project includes application and scripts to create packages and upload new string versions to **Transifex** database.
